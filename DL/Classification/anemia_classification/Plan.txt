Project Plan

-> We will study all of our combinations on all 4 types of images.

-> feature extractors -> hog, surf, other standard feature extractors ...

-> Machine Learning Classifiers -> Random Forest, KNN, SVM, MLP (ANN),

-> We will analyze the performance of all these classifiers against these feature extractor.

-> We will compare the performance of our ML algorithms against differnt feature extractors

To apply deep learning like CNN

-> We will augment the dataset to increase the number of samples in our data

-> We will train different variations of CNN on this augmented datasets

-> We will compare the performance of our different variations of CNN

-> We will compare the performance of ML & DL model

-> Finally we will develop our fianl model, an independent model or combind model of best performing algorithms.

-> We will create API for our final soultion and provide endpoint for public to use our solution.
