I have completed study of data. 
-> Next I have trained classifiers on numeric data available in files. 
-> There were some typos, like ',' was placed instead of '.' in Hgb column. I have replaced these ',' with '.'
-> There was a row containing a none value, so I dropped that row and finally I have 217 records
-> I have replaced 'M' & 'N' with 0 & 1 to feed to classifiers. Similarly, have replaced 'No anemia' or 'No anemia' by 0 & 'Anemia' by 1 in Anemia column
-> The data columns I used are Hgb, Age & Gender. The column to predict was Anemia.
-> I have performed some data analysis which depict that there is high correlation betwen predictor and predictand columns   
-> I used 151 samples as training set and 66 samples as testing set
-> I have trained SVM, KNN, Random Forest, MLP and tensorflow based ANN on training set and tested the performance of models on test set. 

The performance of trained models on test set is as follows:

- ANN 97%
- SVM 98 %
- KNN 98%
- Random Forest 98%
- MLP 97%

Both Neural Networks low performance as compared to machine learning classifiers but overall performance is very promising. 

Next, I am going to start work on classification using image data with opencv based feature extractors and our baseline classifiers as our plan
