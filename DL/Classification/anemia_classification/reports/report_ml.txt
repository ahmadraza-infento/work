To train machine learning based algorithms on images, we need to extract key features
from images to fed to the classifier. In my study, I am using 4 machine learning based 
classifiers to classify images into two classes. I have studied 4 different feature extractors
to describe the images. The feature extractors are: Histogram of Local Binary Patterns (LBPH),
Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), Histogram of Oriented Gradient and 
Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF(ORB). 


The brief description of these feature extractors is as follows:
SIFT:- 
	SIFT is scale and rotation invarient algorithm which makes it applicable in real time 
scnerios. It detects and describe local features in the image and can generate many features
for even smaller objects. Its process includes Difference of Gaussians (DoG) Space Generation,
Keypoints Detection and Feature Description. The described features are bassically fed to the 
classifer and trained on it. 

HOG:- 
	HOG is another famous feature description technique mostly used in object detection applications
from images. It basically counts the occurence of gradient orientation in specific regions of
the image and distributes this computation into specified number of bins, making it histogram of
oriented gradients in the image. 

ORB:-
	ORB is an efficient & viable alternative to SIFT & SURF feature descriptors because both
these algorithms are patened and are not avaialbe freely. ORB performs as well as SIFT does and
performs better than SURF with faster computation as compare to SIFT & SURF. ORB is built upon 
FAST key-points detector and BRIEF feature descriptor. It has enhanced both these algorithms and
is available as single algorithm to detect keypoints and describe those keypoints. 

 
I have 4 different variations of dataset, So I have trained my classifers on all these datasets 
saperately. The performance of these algorithms is described below.

After completing experiments on machine learning based algorithms, here are my findings
- For SIFT(min len width)	-> Best performer is MLP on Palpebral with 77% of accuracy.
- For SIFT(padding)		-> Best performer is MLP on Palpebral with 77% of accuracy.
- For HOG 			-> Best Performer is MLP on Forniceal with 81% of accuracy.
- For ORB			-> Best Performer is KNN on Forniceal with 73% of accuracy.

Finally, overall best machine learning performer is MLP on Forniceal dataset with HOG features. 
We can use this algorithm in production. 


Moreover, I have trained deep learning based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
which is top performer on augmented data with accuracy of 93%. I will submit report 
on CNN tomorrow and will complete API as well by tomorrow. Then I will will try to 
further increase the performance of the models. I am confident we will acheive model
with 95% accuracy.
