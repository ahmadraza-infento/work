Test messages allow you to email yourself or others a copy of your 
message for review before it goes out to your entire list (or lists). 
This makes it easy to review the visual layout, content, and spelling of 
the message in your email client (such as Outlook, Gmail, Yahoo! Mail, 
Outlook.com, Hotmail, etc.).
